# 100_days_of_RTl_design
Hey there👋, I'm Manmohan Verma, and right now, I'm really into VLSI🎯, focusing on something called RTL design using Verilog HDL. My goal is to get really good at RTL in just 1️⃣0️⃣0️⃣ days. To do this, I'm using a cool tool called Xilinx Vivado 2022.2 Design Suite🚀, which helps me make and test my RTL codes👨🏼‍💻. With this tool, I can create complex digital circuits, like those in FPGAs and ASICs, pretty easily. I'm super excited about this journey because I know it'll give me some awesome skills that I can use to solve real-world problems later on.

Here is the list of Day wise RTL Codes:-
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day: 1-> Behavioral Modeling 

Day: 2-> dataflow Modeling 

Day: 3-> Gate Level Modeling 

Day: 4-> Half Adder and Full Adder
